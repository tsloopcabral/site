    <h2>Education and Credentials</h2>
    <p>I hold four degrees, including a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering and an MBA from Georgia Tech, as well as a B.S. in Engineering and Dance from Harvey Mudd College. My academic background spans a diverse range of disciplines, with coursework in subjects ranging from quantum mechanics to ballet.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to my academic achievements, I have extensive teaching experience in both classroom settings and one-on-one instruction. I hold a teaching certification from Georgia Tech, specializing in pedagogy and best practices. I have served as an Instructor at Georgia State University Perimeter College, where I taught an introductory engineering course, and as an engineering tutor at both Harvey Mudd College and Georgia Tech.
    </p>
    <p>Through these diverse credentials and experiences, I have developed a strong teaching methodology and a deep understanding of multiple subjects, allowing me to effectively engage and educate students across disciplines.

    <h2>Ph.D Research</h2>
    <p>My Ph.D research was focused on the dynamic compression and tensile failure of additively manufactured (AM) 316L SS
      with controlled porosity, which essentially means that I shot a cannon at steel with holes in it to see how it fails.</p>
      
    <p>My findings revealed that the presence of these pre-existing pores reduced void formation and visible damage. However, the extent of this effect was highly dependent on pore size and configuration, highlighting the complex relationship between porosity and material strength.</p>
